  "You are a space Agency and the Artemis program is in place. From Earth, you oversee a mission on the Moon.",
  "Your team of astronauts is getting ready to perform a geological analysis of a crater 8 Km away from their position.",
  "To carry the mission out, your astronauts need your supervision to get around, orient themselves, and establish the equipment.",
  "When they get on the Rover, you guide them, turn by turn, crater by crater, on the lookout for the slightest mistake.",
  "Once arrived, you dictate them the installation protocol, step by step. The analysis can then begin.",
  "As a result, you spent multiples hours overseeing the team. However, it is not the only team you have to lead. It is vital to find a way to improve efficiency."
