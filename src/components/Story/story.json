  "You are a space Agency and the Artemis program is in place. From Earth, you oversee a mission on the Moon.",
  "Your team of astronauts is getting ready to perform a geological analysis of a crater 8 Km away from their position.",
  "To carry the mission out, your astronauts need your supervision to get around, orient themselves, and set up the equipment.",
  "When they get on the Rover, you guide them, hill by hill, crater by crater, on the lookout for the slightest mistake.",
  "Once they arrive, you guide them step by step through the installation protocol. Then the analysis can begin.",
  "As a result, you've spent multiples hours overseeing the team. However, they were not the only team you have to lead. Finding a way to improve efficiency is vital."
