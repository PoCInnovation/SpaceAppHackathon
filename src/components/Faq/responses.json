  "The idea behind this innovative solution is to allow the astronauts to gain efficiency and self-sufficiency on the field.This will save time and money, which are essential to you as a space agency.",
  "Caelus will be a set of modules that will assist your astronaut throughout their mission.\nThese modules are attachable to various spots of your astronaut's suit. Each module that is connected is then detected by the virtual assistant, which will receive its data.",
  "The data collected by the virtual assistant will be summarized and displayed on the astronaut's visor.\nThis will allow him to be more efficient and self-sufficient. Moreover, it will allow you to collect data and thus, it will simplify your supervision and optimize your productivity significantly.",
  "Modules will be attached to the suit with magnets, allowing easy application even with gloves.\nMoreover, the HUD is easy to use and non-intrusive allowing the astronaut to focus on his task",
  "The interface will not expose any wiring;\nElectrical current and data will be transmitted by contact. Even if the dust settles on your suit, you can still attach modules to it.",
  "By their simplicity, modules have a low battery consumption, but for extremely long spacewalks, a battery module can be used.",
  "If a module breaks, you don't have to replace the whole suit.\nOur modules are designed to be 3D-printed, allowing your astronaut to only repair the concerned part of the module, saving resources."
